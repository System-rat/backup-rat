# 0.6.0

FINALLY A CHANGE LOG!

This update brings a changelog and some improvements to the CLI.

- added 2 sub-commands:
    - backup - standard backup operations
    - completion - generates the appropriate shell completions
  
  The backup command acts like the old cli except the TARGET value is now
  optional and if it's omitted backs up all non-optional targets.
